This is a minimalistic cli based happy birthday program. Its so simple to the point that to run/execute it you just need a compiler and boom. its all 
yours. This is a free software and you can do anything with it. Its built in c for a bit of speed boost, i tried it in ruby bit i wouldnt be proud of myself if my first program was built in ruby. Okay back to the point, its simple and its fast. Just show it to somebody special e.g. your mom. sister, brother or anyone in that calibre. If it`s your girlfriend go get flowers. You know the drill. clone the repo and compile it and well run it i guess.
